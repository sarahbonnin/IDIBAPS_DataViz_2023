Prerequisites The workshop is open to anyone with no (or little) prior programming experience. Attendees must however feel comfortable enough with their own computer to install programs (and debug their installation, when needed) and locate folders and files. Learning objectives Attendees will: Gain a high-level understanding of data import, manipulation and graphing with R and RStudio. Be able to produce and save a variety of publication-quality graphs (among others: boxplots, histograms, dot plots, heatmaps). Learning outcomes Identify and use RStudio panels (console, scripts, folders and files panels). Locate useful resources to learn more and know where to seek help. Import data from files into R. Manipulate and prepare (filter, select) data. Produce graphs: Create a plot from “recipes”. Change basic parameters (color, font size, point shape, title, etc.). Export high-quality graphs in different formats (pdf, jpeg, png). What this workshop is NOT: A programming class. A data visualization class. What this workshop (hopefully) is: An introduction to data visualization. An introduction to R and to RStudio softwares. A teaser to - hopefully - make you want to learn how to program in R!

For example: the mean() function would take a vector / series of numbers as an input, calculate and output their average. Functions can take arguments/parameters. In the example above, the argument to mean() would be a series of numbers. In R code, you can recognize functions because of the parenthesis (“round brackets”) after the name of the function. 3.2.2 Packages 3.2.2.1 What are packages? A package in R stores, in standardized format, a set of functions, data and documentation. They are developed and shared by the community, and vary in size and complexity. Packages are stored in a library. source Packages are usually found in public repositories such as: CRAN (general repository for any type of data analysis). Bioconductor (initially specialized in high throughput data analysis / bioinformatics) Packages can also be created and stored locally by the programmer. 3.2.2.2 The “tidyverse” The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. source Why do we use the tidyverse packages in this course? Easier to understand / more intuitive vocabulary. Uniform in style and logic across data manipulation and visualization. In this course, we will use in particular, and in that order: {readr} for importing / exporting files. {ggplot2} for data visualization. {tidyr} and {dplyr} for (simple) data manipulation and selection.

These are data-dependent: here, we want to show column1 (a column in data) on the x-axis, and column2 (another column in data) on the y-axis. The base layer is setting the grounds but NOT producing any plot yet. You need to add a layer (with the + sign) to tells R what kind of plot you want to produce out of the data.

The base layer will be the following: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) Adding to this the layer / block called geom_point that will tell ggplot to produce a scatter/point plot: # This line is a comment: a comment is not interpreted by R. # Example of a scatter plot: add the geom_point() layer ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) + geom_point() # Note that the new line is not necessary here Your plot should appear in the “Plots” tab in the bottom-right panel. 8.2.2 Customize the points geom_point() also takes some parameters, including the color of the point, and their size: Color all points in red: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) + geom_point(color=&quot;red&quot;) Make points larger (size default is 1.5): ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) + geom_point(color=&quot;red&quot;, size=2.5) You can also have different shapes for the points! This is done by setting the shape parameter in geom_point().

We may want to show the gene names that correspond to those points.

We can set the nudge_x parameter, to move the labels horizontally (on the x axis). ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2, label=genes)) + geom_point() + geom_text(nudge_x=1.5) We can also decrease or increase the label size: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2, label=genes)) + geom_point() + geom_text(nudge_x=1.5, size=3) Last but not least: point color can be dependent on another column / variable of the data. The column we want to use to color the points should be specified inside the aes() function: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2, label=genes, color=DE)) + geom_point() + geom_text(nudge_x=1.2, size=3) Colors can be set manually using (yet another) layer: scale_color_manual(). This is becoming more complex in terms of code structure: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2, label=genes, color=DE)) + geom_point() + geom_text(nudge_x=1.2, size=3) + scale_color_manual(values=c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) "],["bar-plots.html", "8.6 Bar plots", " 8.6 Bar plots A bar plot (or bar chart) is a graph that represents categorical data with rectangular bars, which heights are proportional to the values they represent. The first layer of the ggplot() function will be similar. However, note that we start with only the x= parameter set in aes() function (this is the basic way to plot a barplot): ggplot(data=dataframe, mapping=aes(x=column1)) ggplot(data=dataframe, mapping=aes(x=column1)) + geom_bar() Using our previous geneexp data, we can produce a bar plot out of the DE column, such as: ggplot(geneexp, aes(x=DE)) + geom_bar() This produces a barplots containing 3 bars: Down, No and Up: their height represents the number of genes found in each category. 8.6.1 Exercise 2 Import file DataViz_source_files-main/files/gencode.v44.annotation.csv in R, into an object called gtf. correction gtf &lt;- read_csv(&quot;DataViz_source_files-main/files/gencode.v44.annotation.csv&quot;) This is a subset of the gencode v44 human gene annotation: Only protein coding, long non-coding, miRNAs, snRNAs and snoRNAs Limited to chromosomes 1 to 10 Random subset of 1000 genes Converted to a friendly csv format. Create a simple barplot representing the count of genes per chromosome: correction ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr)) + geom_bar() Keeping the chromosome on the x axis, split the barplot per gene type. TIP: remember how we set color= in mapping=aes() function in the scatter plot section? correction ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr, color=gene_type)) + geom_bar() Now try with fill instead of color: correction ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr, fill=gene_type)) + geom_bar() Add a title to the graph: correction ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr, fill=gene_type)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + ggtitle(label = &quot;Number of genes per chromosome, split by gene type&quot;) Change the theme: correction ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr, fill=gene_type)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + ggtitle(label = &quot;Number of genes per chromosome, split by gene type&quot;) + theme_bw() Save graph in PNG format in the course’s directory. 8.6.2 Bars positions We can also play with the position of the bars. By default, position is stack, i.e. categories are stacked on top of each other along the bar. Position fill will show the proportions, instead of the absolute values, of each category: ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr, fill=gene_type)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;fill&quot;) Position dodge is representing each category (here, continents), next to each other: ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr, fill=gene_type)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) More advanced (as reference, or if someone asks): how to reorder x-axis labels: correction ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=factor(chr, levels=c(&quot;chr1&quot;, &quot;chr2&quot;, &quot;chr3&quot;, &quot;chr4&quot;, &quot;chr5&quot;, &quot;chr6&quot;, &quot;chr7&quot;, &quot;chr8&quot;, &quot;chr9&quot;, &quot;chr10&quot;), ordered=T), fill=gene_type)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + xlab(&quot;chromosome&quot;) 8.6.3 stats=“identity” parameter We will now see a different type of data R can produce a barplot from. Let’s import data from file: DataViz_source_files-main/files/stats_continents_barcelona_2013-2023_long.csv into an object called statsbcn. The data contains the number of foreign residents in Barcelona from 2013 to 2023. statsbcn &lt;- read_csv(&quot;DataViz_source_files-main/files/stats_continents_barcelona_2013-2023_long.csv&quot;) How many rows and how many columns does the data contain? In the barplots we created so far, R takes categories in the columns specified x= and counts the number of occurrences. The argument stat=“identity” in geom_bar() is telling R to calculate the sum of the y variable, grouped by the x variable: bars of the barplot will display the sums. In the following example, we are plotting the sum of foreign residents in Barcelona (Population provided in y) per year (Year provided in x): ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) Here, we would provide Continent to fill: ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=Year, y=Population, fill=Continent)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) We can here again play with the position. Position fill : ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=Year, y=Population, fill=Continent)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;fill&quot;) Position dodge : ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=Year, y=Population, fill=Continent)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;) More advanced (as reference, or if someone asks): display all labels: correction Convert “Year” column as character, instead of numbers: ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=as.character(Year), y=Population, fill=Continent)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
