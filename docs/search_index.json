Prerequisites The workshop is open to anyone with no (or little) prior programming experience. Attendees must however feel comfortable enough with their own computer to install programs (and debug their installation, when needed) and locate folders and files. Learning objectives Attendees will: Gain a high-level understanding of data import, manipulation and graphing with R and RStudio. Be able to produce and save a variety of publication-quality graphs (among others: boxplots, scatter plots, barplots). Learning outcomes Identify and use RStudio panels (console, scripts, folders and files panels). Locate useful resources to learn more and know where to seek help. Import data from files into R. Manipulate and prepare (filter, select) data. Produce graphs: Create a plot from “recipes”. Change basic parameters (color, font size, point shape, title, etc.). Export high-quality graphs in different formats (pdf, jpeg, png). What this workshop is NOT: A programming class. A design class. What this workshop is: An introduction to R and to RStudio software. An introduction to data visualization. A teaser to - hopefully - make you want to learn how to program in R! Approximate agenda Day 1 &amp; 2: 9:30-13:30. ~30’ break around 11:30.

Many resources and forums available "],["functions-packages.html", "3.2 Functions &amp; packages", " 3.2 Functions &amp; packages 3.2.1 Functions A function in R is a piece of code that takes an input (user data, parameters), processes some calculation, and outputs data. For example: the mean() function would take a vector / series of numbers as an input, calculate and output their average. Functions can take arguments/parameters. In the example above, the main argument to mean() would be a series of numbers given by the user. In R code, you can recognize functions because of the parenthesis (“round brackets”) following their name. 3.2.2 Packages 3.2.2.1 What are packages? A package in R stores, in standardized format, a set of functions, data and documentation. They are developed and shared by the community, and vary in size and complexity. Packages are stored in a library. source Packages are usually found in public repositories such as: CRAN (general repository for any type of data analysis). Bioconductor (initially specialized in high throughput data analysis / bioinformatics) Anyone can create a package and stored it locally; creating packages is a great way to share code. The previous function, mean(), is part of the {base} package that is available by default. 3.2.2.2 The “tidyverse” The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. source Why do we use the tidyverse packages in this course? Easier to understand / more intuitive vocabulary: better for beginners. More “modern” style of coding. Uniform in style and logic across data manipulation and visualization. In this course, we will use in particular, and in that order: {readr} for importing / exporting files. {ggplot2} for data visualization. {dplyr} for (simple) data manipulation and selection.

The base layer will be the following: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) Try to copy-paste it in the console, and hit Enter. As you can see, nothing is actually plotted yet, but the base is set. Adding to this the geometrics called geom_point(), we tell ggplot to produce a scatter/point plot: # This line is a comment: a comment is not interpreted by R. # Example of a scatter plot: add the geom_point() layer ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) + geom_point() # Note that the new line is not necessary after the &quot;+&quot;: it is done for readibility.

Functions in ggplot2 (and tidyverse in general) are richly documented. While documentation can be quite technical it is always good practice to take a look at it. You can access the help page of a function in the Help tab in the bottom-right panel. Give it a try with “geom_point”: Back to our customization: you can set different shapes for the points! This is done by setting the shape parameter in geom_point().

In the barplots we created so far, R takes categories in the columns specified in x= and counts the number of occurrences. The argument stat=“identity” in geom_bar() is telling R to calculate the sum of the variable specified in y=, grouped by the x variable: bars of the barplot will display the sums. In the following example, we are plotting the sum of foreign residents in Barcelona (Population provided in y) per year (Year provided in x): ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) Here, we can provide Continent to fill: ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=Year, y=Population, fill=Continent)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) We can here again play with the position. Position fill : ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=Year, y=Population, fill=Continent)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;fill&quot;) Position dodge : ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=Year, y=Population, fill=Continent)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;) More advanced (as reference, or if someone asks): display all labels: Convert “Year” column as character, instead of numbers: ggplot(statsbcn, aes(x=as.character(Year), y=Population, fill=Continent)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;) "],["boxplots.html", "8.9 Boxplots", " 8.9 Boxplots A boxplot is used to visualize the distribution of data.

While boxplots can only show summary statistics / quantiles, violin plots also show the density of each variable.

Changing text size in ggplot2 graphs should be done using the theme() package, that unfortunately utilizes a difficult structure. We will illustrate some font size modifications on our very first scatter plot. Change overall font size: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;scatter plot&quot;) + theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) Change font size of axis text: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;scatter plot&quot;) + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 20)) Change font size of axis titles: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;scatter plot&quot;) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20)) Change font size of the main title: ggplot(data=geneexp, mapping=aes(x=sample1, y=sample2)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;scatter plot&quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20)) If you want to learn more, you can check this complete guide on how to modify the ggplot2 theme. "],["colors.html", "8.11 Colors", " 8.11 Colors Colors can be set a different way in ggplot2, and in R in general. The easiest way is to fetch the colors by their names. There are 657 color names available for you to pick! You can check them by pasting the following in the console: colors() ggplot2 provides a color scale by default. Mainy different palettes are available to change the default scale. You can easily pick palettes from the RColorBrewer package, that is included in ggplot2. Available palettes are shown below: We can easily take advantage of the RColorBrewer’s palettes by using either scale_color_brewer() or scale_fill_brewer() layers (depending if color or fill was set in aes(), respectively): ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr, fill=gene_type)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + scale_fill_brewer() The default palette used is the “Blues” palette.

However, there is one variable that we did not consider: strand. Using the faceting function facet_wrap, one can easily split that barplot into 2 plots: one will represent the + strand, one will represent the - strand. ggplot(data=gtf, mapping=aes(x=chr, fill=gene_type)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + facet_wrap(~strand) "],["data-filtering.html", "Part9 Data filtering", " Part9 Data filtering We will now see a couple of basic functions to filter and select a data object.

Logical operators: Operator Description &lt; less than &lt;= less than or equal to &gt; greater than &gt;= greater than or equal to == exactly equal to != not equal to !x not x x y x &amp; y x AND y We can have several conditions.
