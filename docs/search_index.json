Prerequisites The workshop is open to anyone with no (or little) prior programming experience. Attendees must however feel comfortable enough with their own computer to install programs (and debug their installation, when needed) and locate folders and files. Learning objectives Attendees will: Gain a high-level understanding of data import, manipulation and graphing with R and RStudio. Be able to produce and save a variety of publication-quality graphs (among others: boxplots, histograms, dot plots, heatmaps). Learning outcomes Identify and use RStudio panels (console, scripts, folders and files panels). Locate useful resources to learn more and know where to seek help. Import data from files into R. Manipulate and prepare (filter, select) data. Produce graphs: Create a plot from “recipes”. Change basic parameters (color, font size, point shape, title, etc.). Export high-quality graphs in different formats (pdf, jpeg, png). What this workshop is NOT: A programming class. A solution to all data visualization problems. What this workshop (hopefully) is: An introduction to data visualization. An introduction to R and to R Studio softwarea. A teaser to make you want to learn how to program in R! Agenda Note that the agenda may be adjusted depending on the pace of the students. Day 1: 9:30-10:00 (30’): course introduction + check the set up. 10:00-10:45 (45’): introduction to R and Rstudio (Posit). 10:45-11:30 (45’): import data / read files. 11:30-12:00 (30’): break 12:00-12:30 (30’): ggplot2: concept and structure. 12:30-13:00 (30’:) guided boxplots, scatter plots, barplots, pie plots. 13:00-13:30 (30’): exercises / changing graph parameters. Day 2: 9:30-10:00 (30’): recall what was done on day 1 with a “warm up” exercise. 10:00-10:45 (45’): introduction to simple data wrangling to filter and select data. 10:45-11:30 (45’): exercises with filtering + graphs. 11:30-12:00 (30’): break. 12:00-12:30 (30’): introduction to interactive plotting with plotly. 12:30-13:15 (45’): exercises combining what we learned so far. 13:15-13:30 (15’): workshop wrap up.

For example: the mean() function would take a vector / series of numbers as an input, calculate and output their average. 3.2.2 Packages A package in R stores, in standardized format, a set of functions, data and documentation. They are developed and shared by the community, and vary in size and complexity. Packages are stored in a library. source 3.2.2.1 The “tidyverse” The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. source Why do we use the tidyverse packages in this course? Easier to understand / more intuitive vocabulary. Uniform across data manipulation and visualization. In this course, we will use in particular, and in that order: {readr} for importing / exporting files. {ggplot2} for data visualization. {tidyr} and {dplyr} for (simple) data manipulation and selection.
