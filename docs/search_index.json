[["index.html", "Data visualization with R and ggplot2: from data to publication-quality graphics Part1 Welcome", " Data visualization with R and ggplot2: from data to publication-quality graphics Sarah Bonnin 2023-09-22 Part1 Welcome Dates, time &amp; location Dates: First edition: September 27-28 Second edition: October 18-19 Time: 9:30-13:30 Location: IDIBAPS Instructor Sarah Bonnin Bioinformatics consultant at Clarivate. Prerequisites The workshop is open to anyone with no (or little) prior programming experience. Attendees must however feel comfortable enough with their own computer to install programs (and debug their installation, when needed) and locate folders and files. Learning objectives Attendees will: Gain a high-level understanding of data import, manipulation and graphing with R and RStudio. Be able to produce and save a variety of publication-quality graphs (among others: boxplots, histograms, dot plots, heatmaps). Learning outcomes Identify and use RStudio panels (console, scripts, folders and files panels). Locate useful resources to learn more and know where to seek help. Import data from files into R. Manipulate and prepare (filter, select) data. Produce graphs: Create a plot from “recipes”. Change basic parameters (color, font size, point shape, title, etc.). Export high-quality graphs in different formats (pdf, jpeg, png). What this workshop is NOT: A programming class. A data visualization class. What this workshop (hopefully) is: An introduction to data visualization. An introduction to R and to RStudio softwares. A teaser to - hopefully - make you want to learn how to program in R! Agenda Note that the agenda may be adjusted depending on the pace of the group Day 1: 9:30-10:00 (30’): course introduction + check the set up. 10:00-10:45 (45’): introduction to R and Rstudio (Posit). 10:45-11:30 (45’): import data / read files. 11:30-12:00 (30’): break 12:00-12:30 (30’): ggplot2: concept and structure. 12:30-13:00 (30’:) guided boxplots, scatter plots, barplots, pie plots. 13:00-13:30 (30’): exercises / changing graph parameters.

For example: the mean() function would take a vector / series of numbers as an input, calculate and output their average. Functions can take arguments/parameters. In the example above, the argument to mean() would be a series of numbers. In R code, you can recognize functions because of the parenthesis (“round brackets”) after the name of the function. 3.2.2 Packages 3.2.2.1 What are packages? A package in R stores, in standardized format, a set of functions, data and documentation. They are developed and shared by the community, and vary in size and complexity. Packages are stored in a library. source Packages are usually found in public repositories such as: CRAN (general repository for any type of data analysis). Bioconductor (initially specialized in high throughput data analysis / bioinformatics) Packages can also be created and stored locally by the programmer. 3.2.2.2 The “tidyverse” The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. source Why do we use the tidyverse packages in this course? Easier to understand / more intuitive vocabulary. Uniform in style and logic across data manipulation and visualization. In this course, we will use in particular, and in that order: {readr} for importing / exporting files. {ggplot2} for data visualization. {tidyr} and {dplyr} for (simple) data manipulation and selection.

Remember that functions are followed by parenthesis/round brackets. Upon clicking Enter/Return, you are asking the R kernel to execute the function. What R returns is the response/result, after computing the content of the code. The getwd() function outputs your current working directory.

Your home directory is the one that hosts the user (you) data: it should be similar to all operating system, for example: /users/sbonnin (Linux) /Users/sbonnin (macOS) C:\\Users\\sbonnin (Windows) Starting “/” or “\\” is called the root directory. Directories branch downwards from the root directory, and can contain both files and subdirectories. In the examples above, sbonnin is a subdirectory of users (or Users).

Choose the folder under which you would like to save the workshop’s work. For example, you can create a new folder under Home -&gt; Documents. Click on “Home” and then on “Documents”: Create a folder called “DataViz_2023” by clicking on the “+Folder” icon. You should now see a new folder: Double-click on the newly created “DataViz_2023” folder, still under the “Files” tab. Click on the “More file commands button”: Click on “Set As Working Directory”: The working directory is where R will, by default, find files to read, and that is where it will also save files and figures, if not specified otherwise.
