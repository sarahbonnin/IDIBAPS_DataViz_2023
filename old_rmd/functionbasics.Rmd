# Functions

In programming, a function is a section of a program that **performs a specific task**.

For example, the function **getwd** is used as:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```
and has the task of outputting the current working directory.

You can recognize a function with the **round brackets**: function**()**
 
A function can also take *arguments/parameters*
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd(dir="Rcourse")
```
**setwd** changes the current working directory and takes one argument **dir**.

* Assign the output of a function to an object:

* Getting help: <br>

From the terminal:

```{r}
help(getwd)
?getwd
```

From the RStudio bottom-right panel:<br>

* The help pages show:
	+ required/optional argument(s), if any.
	+ default values for each argument(s), if any.
	+ examples.
	+ detailed description.

* Get the example of a function:
```{r}

* **Note on arguments**

The help page shows the compulsory arguments in the **Usage** section: in the help page of getwd and setwd (above), you can see that getwd doesn't take any compulsory argument, and setwd takes one compulsory argument that is called dir.
<br>
Compulsory arguments can be given **with their names**: in such case you don't need to respect a specific order, or **without their names**, in which case you have to respect the order specified in the help page!<br>
For example, the **rep.int** function (a variant of the rep function) takes 2 arguments (see in help page): **x** and **times**, in that order:

```{r}
# use arguments with their names:
rep.int(x=1, times=3)
# use arguments with their names without respecting the order:
rep.int(times=3, x=1)
# use arguments without their names but respecting the order:
rep.int(1, 3)
# use arguments without their names without respecting the order:
rep.int(3, 1)
# It works, but is not giving the expected output!
```
