<h3> Dates, time & location </h3>

* Dates:
  * First edition: September 27-28

* Time:
	* 9:30-13:30 <br>

* Location:
	* IDIBAPS

<h3> Instructor </h3>
 
[Sarah Bonnin](mailto:bonninsarah@gmail.com) 

Bioinformatics consultant at [Clarivate](https://clarivate.com/).

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

The workshop is open to anyone with **no (or little) prior programming experience**.

Attendees must however **feel comfortable enough with their own computer to install programs** (and debug their installation, when needed) and **locate folders and files**.

<h3> Learning objectives</h3>

Attendees will:

* Gain a high-level understanding of data import, manipulation and graphing with R and RStudio. 
* Be able to produce and save a variety of publication-quality graphs (among others: boxplots, histograms, dot plots, heatmaps).

<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>

* Identify and use RStudio panels (console, scripts, folders and files panels).
* Locate useful resources to learn more and know where to seek help.
* Import data from files into R.
* Manipulate and prepare (filter, select) data.
* Produce graphs:
  * Create a plot from “recipes”.
  * Change basic parameters (color, font size, point shape, title, etc.).
  * Export high-quality graphs in different formats (pdf, jpeg, png).

<h4>What this workshop is **NOT**:</h4>

* A programming class.
* A solution to all data visualization problems.

<h4>What this workshop (hopefully) is:</h4>

* An introduction to data visualization.
* An introduction to R and to R Studio softwarea.
* A teaser to make you want to learn how to program in R!

<h3>Agenda</h3>

*Note that the agenda may be adjusted depending on the pace of the students.*

Day 1:

* 9:30-10:00 (30’): course introduction + check the set up.

Day 2:

* 9:30-10:00 (30’): recall what was done on day 1 with a “warm up” exercise.
