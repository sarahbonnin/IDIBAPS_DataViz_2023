# R basics

## Arithmetic operators

| Operator  | Function      |
|:--------: |:-------------:|
|     +     | addition      |
|     -     | subtraction   |
|     /     | division      |
|     *     | multiplication|
|  ^ or **  | exponential   |

In the R terminal, as you have seen before, you can type the following:

```{r}
10 - 2
```

And hit **Enter** for R to interpret the command, and give you the output.

## Objects in R

Everything that stores any kind of data in R is an **object**:

## Assignment operators

+ **<-** or **=**
+ Essentially the same but, to avoid confusions:
  + Use **<-** for assignments
  + Keep **=** for functions arguments

## Assigning data to an object

* Assigning a value to the object named **B**:

Copy-paste the following in the console, and hit Enter.

```{r}
B <- 10
```

* Reassigning: modifying the content of an object:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
B + 10
```

<span style="color:red">**B unchanged !!**</span><br>
```{r, eval=FALSE}
B <- B + 10
```

<span style="color:red">**B changed !!**</span><br>

* You can see the objects you created in the upper right panel in RStudio that is, the environment.
