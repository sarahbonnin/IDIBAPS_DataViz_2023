## The R console

The R console (bottom-left panel) is where the magic happens.

It is where the user/programmer/you will interact with R.

Let's give it a try. Type (or copy-paste) the following in the console, and hit Enter/Return:

```{r}
getwd()
```

getwd() is a function. Note: you can detect functions because they use parenthesis/round brackets.

Upon clicking Enter/Return, you are sending this function to the R kernel.

What R returns is the response, after computing the function.

The getwd() function provides your current working directory.

Let's try to interact a bit more with the console: copy-paste the following, and hit Enter:

```{r}
7*3
```

R gives you the results of this simple multiplication.
