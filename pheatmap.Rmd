# Bonus: heatmaps with {pheatmap}

We will introduce package **{pheatmap}** to produce heatmaps.

First we can install **pheatmap** (bottom-right panel -> Packages -> Install).

And then we load the package: **tick** the package in the list.

**pheatmap** is not from the tidyverse package, and does not follow the same structure. It does not work with layers, but with multiple parameters inside a same function.

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=15, fig.width=10}
library(pheatmap)
```


Let's read again one of our first data file:

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
expr_heatmap <- read_csv("DataViz_source_files-main/files/GSE150029_rnaseq_for_heatmap.csv") %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "gene_name") %>%
  as.matrix()
```

```{r}
pheatmap(expr_heatmap)
```
